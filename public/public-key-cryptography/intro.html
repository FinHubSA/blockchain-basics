                    <h2>What is Public Key Cryptography?</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Public Key Cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system 
                        that uses pairs of keys: a public key and a private key. These keys are mathematically 
                        related but cannot be derived from each other easily.
                    </p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Key Concept:</strong> The public key can be shared openly, while the private key 
                        must be kept secret. This fundamental property enables secure communication and digital 
                        signatures without requiring a shared secret beforehand.
                    </div>

                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        In public key cryptography:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Public Key:</strong> Can be freely distributed and used to encrypt messages 
                        or verify signatures. Anyone can have access to this key.</li>
                        <li><strong>Private Key:</strong> Must be kept secret. It's used to decrypt messages 
                        encrypted with the corresponding public key, or to create digital signatures.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Properties</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>One-way Function:</strong> It's computationally infeasible to derive the 
                        private key from the public key.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematical Relationship:</strong> The keys are mathematically linked, 
                        allowing operations performed with one key to be verified or reversed with the other.</li>
                        <li><strong>Security:</strong> The security relies on mathematical problems that are 
                        difficult to solve, such as the discrete logarithm problem in elliptic curve cryptography.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encrypt data with a public key so only the holder of 
                        the private key can decrypt it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Sign data with a private key so anyone with the 
                        public key can verify the signature's authenticity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Prove identity without revealing the private key.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ethereum uses <strong>secp256k1</strong>, a specific elliptic curve defined by the 
                        Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG). This curve is also used by Bitcoin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advantages of ECC:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smaller key sizes for equivalent security compared to RSA</li>
                        <li>Faster computation</li>
                        <li>Lower memory and bandwidth requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> Never share your private key! If someone gains access to 
                        your private key, they can impersonate you and access all your assets.
