                    <h2>What is a Distributed Ledger?</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        A <strong>distributed ledger</strong> is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized 
                        across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies. Unlike traditional centralized databases, 
                        distributed ledgers have no central administrator or central storage. Instead, they are maintained 
                        by a network of participants, each holding an identical copy of the ledger.
                    </p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Key Concept:</strong> In a distributed ledger, all participants can see the same data 
                        simultaneously, and any changes are reflected across all copies in near real-time. This creates 
                        transparency and reduces the risk of fraud or manipulation.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Core Components</h3>
                    <p>
                        A distributed ledger consists of three fundamental components:
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Accounts</h3>
                    <p>
                        An <strong>account</strong> in a distributed ledger represents an entity that can hold balances 
                        and initiate transactions. In Ethereum, there are two types of accounts:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):</strong> Controlled by private keys. These are 
                        user accounts that can send transactions and hold Ether (ETH) or other tokens.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contract Accounts:</strong> Controlled by code (smart contracts). These accounts 
                        have associated code that executes when they receive transactions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Each account has a unique address (derived from its public key) and can hold a balance of 
                        cryptocurrency or tokens.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Balances</h3>
                    <p>
                        A <strong>balance</strong> represents the amount of cryptocurrency or tokens held by an account. 
                        In Ethereum:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Balances are stored in the ledger state</li>
                        <li>Each account's balance is publicly visible on the blockchain</li>
                        <li>Balances can only be modified through valid transactions</li>
                        <li>The ledger maintains a complete history of all balance changes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Ethereum Denominations: Wei, Gwei, and Ether</strong>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                            Ethereum uses multiple denominations to represent different amounts of Ether, similar to how 
                            dollars have cents. The smallest unit is <strong>Wei</strong>, and all other units are 
                            multiples of Wei:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                            <li><strong>Wei:</strong> The smallest unit of Ether, named after Wei Dai (creator of b-money). 
                            This is the base unit used internally by the Ethereum protocol. 1 Wei = 1 Wei</li>
                            <li><strong>Gwei (Gigawei):</strong> A commonly used unit for gas prices and smaller amounts. 
                            1 Gwei = 1,000,000,000 Wei (10⁹ Wei) = 0.000000001 ETH. "Gwei" stands for "giga-wei" 
                            (giga = billion).</li>
                            <li><strong>Ether (ETH):</strong> The standard unit most people use. 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei 
                            (10¹⁸ Wei) = 1,000,000,000 Gwei (10⁹ Gwei).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                            <strong>Why multiple units?</strong> Wei allows for precise calculations and prevents rounding 
                            errors. Gwei is convenient for gas prices (e.g., "20 Gwei" is easier than "20000000000 Wei"). 
                            ETH is the human-readable unit for everyday use. When working with smart contracts or 
                            transaction APIs, values are often specified in Wei.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The ledger ensures that balances are always accurate and that no funds can be created or 
                        destroyed without following the protocol's rules.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Transactions</h3>
                    <p>
                        A <strong>transaction</strong> is a signed instruction from an account to transfer value or 
                        execute a smart contract. Key characteristics of transactions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>From:</strong> The account initiating the transaction (sender)</li>
                        <li><strong>To:</strong> The recipient account address</li>
                        <li><strong>Value:</strong> The amount of cryptocurrency to transfer</li>
                        <li><strong>Nonce:</strong> A number that prevents transaction replay attacks</li>
                        <li><strong>Gas Price:</strong> The fee paid to miners/validators</li>
                        <li><strong>Gas Limit:</strong> The maximum computational work allowed</li>
                        <li><strong>Signature:</strong> Cryptographic proof that the transaction was authorized by 
                        the account owner</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Understanding Gas and Gas Prices:</strong> Gas is the unit that measures the computational 
                        work required to execute operations on the Ethereum network. Every operation (transferring ETH, 
                        calling a smart contract function, deploying a contract) consumes a specific amount of gas.
                        <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                            <li><strong>Gas Limit:</strong> The maximum amount of gas you're willing to spend on a 
                            transaction. This prevents runaway transactions from consuming all your funds. For simple 
                            ETH transfers, 21,000 gas is standard. Complex smart contract interactions may require much more.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gas Price:</strong> The amount of Ether (in Gwei, where 1 Gwei = 10⁹ Wei = 10⁻⁹ ETH) 
                            you're willing to pay per unit of gas. Higher gas prices incentivize miners/validators to include 
                            your transaction faster, but cost more.</li>
                            <li><strong>Total Cost:</strong> Transaction fee = Gas Limit × Gas Price. For example, if you 
                            set a gas limit of 21,000 and gas price of 20 Gwei, your transaction fee would be 
                            21,000 × 20 Gwei = 420,000 Gwei = 0.00042 ETH.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                            Gas prices fluctuate based on network demand. During high traffic periods, users may need to 
                            pay higher gas prices to get their transactions processed quickly.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Transaction Flow:</strong> When a transaction is created, it must be signed with the 
                        sender's private key. This signature proves ownership and authorization. The signed transaction 
                        is then broadcast to the network, validated, and added to the ledger.
                    </div>

                    <h3>How Distributed Ledgers Work</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Transaction Creation:</strong> A user creates a transaction to transfer funds or 
                        execute a smart contract, signing it with their private key.</li>
                        <li><strong>Broadcasting:</strong> The signed transaction is broadcast to the network of 
                        nodes (computers maintaining the ledger).</li>
                        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Network nodes validate the transaction by checking:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The signature is valid</li>
                                <li>The sender has sufficient balance</li>
                                <li>The transaction format is correct</li>
                                <li>The nonce is valid (prevents replay attacks)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Consensus:</strong> Network participants agree on which transactions to include 
                        and in what order (through consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake).</li>
                        <li><strong>Recording:</strong> Valid transactions are grouped into blocks and added to the 
                        ledger, updating all account balances accordingly.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Blockchain as a State Machine</h3>
                    <p>
                        A blockchain can be understood as a <strong>state machine</strong> - a system that maintains a 
                        current state and transitions to a new state when transactions are processed. Each block in the 
                        blockchain represents a state transition, moving the entire system from one valid state to another.
                    </p>

                    <div style="margin: 20px 0; text-align: center;">
                        <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240829122823/blockchainstruct1.webp" 
                             alt="Blockchain Structure as State Machine" 
                             style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">
                            <strong>Blockchain State Machine:</strong> Each block contains transactions that transition the 
                            blockchain from one state to another, with each block verifying the integrity of the previous state.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Understanding State in Blockchain</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>state</strong> of a blockchain at any given point includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Account Balances:</strong> The current balance of every account in the network</li>
                        <li><strong>Smart Contract Storage:</strong> The current values stored in all smart contracts</li>
                        <li><strong>Account Nonces:</strong> The transaction count for each account (prevents replay attacks)</li>
                        <li><strong>Contract Code:</strong> The bytecode of all deployed smart contracts</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>State Transitions</h4>
                    <p>
                        When a block is added to the blockchain:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Initial State:</strong> The blockchain starts with the state from the previous block 
                        (or genesis state for the first block)</li>
                        <li><strong>Transaction Processing:</strong> Each transaction in the block is executed, which 
                        modifies the state:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Transferring value between accounts updates balances</li>
                                <li>Executing smart contract functions updates contract storage</li>
                                <li>Deploying contracts adds new contract code to the state</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>New State:</strong> After processing all transactions, the blockchain reaches a 
                        new valid state</li>
                        <li><strong>State Root:</strong> The new state is cryptographically hashed into a "state root" 
                        (Merkle root) that represents the entire state in a single hash</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>State Verification in Blocks</h4>
                    <p>
                        Each block in the blockchain contains a <strong>state root</strong> (or state hash) that serves 
                        as a cryptographic proof of the entire blockchain state at that point. This is crucial because:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The state root in the current block verifies that all 
                        previous blocks have been processed correctly and the state is valid</li>
                        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Any change to any account balance, contract storage, or previous 
                        transaction would result in a different state root, immediately revealing tampering</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Instead of storing all account data in every block, only the 
                        state root hash is stored, making the blockchain more efficient</li>
                        <li><strong>Consensus:</strong> All nodes can independently verify they have the same state by 
                        comparing state roots</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The state root in each block acts like a fingerprint of the entire 
                        blockchain state. If even a single account balance changes, the state root changes completely, 
                        making it impossible to alter the blockchain without detection.
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        This state machine model ensures that:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The blockchain always maintains a consistent, verifiable state</li>
                        <li>All nodes can independently verify they have the correct state</li>
                        <li>Historical states can be reconstructed by replaying transactions from the genesis block</li>
                        <li>The entire system behaves deterministically - the same transactions always produce the same state</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions are visible to all participants</li>
                        <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once recorded, transactions cannot be easily altered</li>

                        careful management of private keys. If you lose your private key, you lose access to your

                    <h3>Ethereum as a Distributed Ledger</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ethereum is a prominent example of a distributed ledger that:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintains account balances in Ether (ETH) and other tokens</li>
                        <li>Records all transactions in a public, immutable blockchain</li>
                        <li>Uses cryptographic signatures (secp256k1) to authorize transactions</li>
                        <li>Allows execution of smart contracts through transactions</li>
                        <li>Operates on a global network of nodes that maintain identical copies of the ledger</li>
                    </ul>
